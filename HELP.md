After installing this add-on on Google Sheets, you now have access to the *PINYIN()* and *JYUTPING()* functions.
- Type some chinese text into cell A1 such as 你好
- In cell A2, enter the formula *=PINYIN(A1)*. You should see the text *nǐhǎo* appear.
- Similarly, you can use the *JYUTPING()* formula for Cantonese.
