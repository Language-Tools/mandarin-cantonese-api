# Google Sheets add-on
This library is available in the form of a Google Sheets Add-on. You can read about it here: https://medium.com/@lucw/converting-chinese-characters-to-pinyin-or-jyutping-on-google-sheets-eb12cca669cb

## Manually enabling the add-on
Due to some obscure Google App API issue, new users cannot sign up for the add-on. If you get an error about not being able to log-in, try the following:
* open this

* then in your google sheets doc, go to tools, script editor
* paste the code above, save it. Then you may need to reload your spreadsheet.
